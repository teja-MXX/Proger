My First Flask APP which stores tools technologies you've learned and projects you've done . 

In this project we can create an account and can add tools and technologies we've learnt . 
And make sure to remove my photo in the main page . Haha xD .
We can add projects and their details . And I am very HTML and CSS coder . This is built in the view of a Desktop or Laptop .
It may look worse in Mobile . Can help if you are a good UI designer

Requirements are - 
1. flask
2. Flask-SQLAlchemy
